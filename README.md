##Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world! This guide will help you set up your Java project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and run it in a Tomcat server environment.
Follow these steps to get started writing and running Java code smoothly.

##Folder Structure
By default, the workspace for your Java project contains the following folders:

src: This folder is where you will store your source code files, such as .java files.

lib: This folder is used to store any dependencies or external libraries required for your project.

bin: This folder holds the compiled files, such as .class files, generated when you compile your project.

If you'd like to customize the folder structure, you can easily adjust the settings by opening the .vscode/settings.json file and modifying the related configuration.

##Dependency Management
VS Code provides an easy-to-use JAVA PROJECTS view that allows you to manage your project’s dependencies.

You can add and manage external libraries using the "Add Dependency" feature in the JAVA PROJECTS view.
For more advanced dependency management, you can refer to the VS Code Java Dependency Management Guide.
##Running the Project
Create a WAR File
To run your Java project on a Tomcat server in Visual Studio Code, you first need to create a WAR file. Here’s how you can do that:

1.Generate the WAR File:

Open the terminal in VS Code (or use your system’s terminal).

Navigate to your project directory where your WebContent folder is located.

Run the following command to create the WAR file:

bash
Copy code
jar -cvf your-project.war -C WebContent/ .
Replace your-project.war with your preferred WAR file name. Ensure that WebContent/ is the correct directory containing your web application content (like WEB-INF, JSP files, etc.).

2.Deploy the WAR File on Tomcat:

Open Tomcat (either using the VS Code extension or your local Tomcat installation).
Right-click on the newly created WAR file and choose "Run on Tomcat". This will deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat server.

3.View the Application in the Browser:

After deploying the WAR file, right-click on the Tomcat server and select "Open in Browser" to open your application in your default web browser.
You should now be able to access and test your web application live.

##Troubleshooting

~Tomcat Server Not Running: If you encounter issues with Tomcat not running, make sure the Tomcat server is properly installed and running in your environment. You may need the Tomcat for VS Code extension for smoother integration.

~WAR Deployment Errors: If the WAR file fails to deploy, verify the directory structure when creating the WAR file. It should include all necessary directories and files (e.g., WEB-INF, index.jsp, etc.).
